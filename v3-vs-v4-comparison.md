# V3 vs V4 Layout Comparison

## No HRM Dedicated (V3) vs 4-Layer Balanced (V4)

Both V3 and V4 layouts avoid the complexity of Home Row Modifiers, making them ideal for users transitioning from traditional keyboards. However, they take different approaches to achieve this simplicity.

## Quick Summary

| Aspect | V3 (No HRM Dedicated) | V4 (4-Layer Balanced) |
|--------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Layers** | 6 layers (traditional Miryoku) | 4 layers (optimized) |
| **Modifiers** | Dedicated keys in outer positions | Dedicated keys in strategic positions |
| **Number Access** | Via layers only | Direct number row + layers |
| **Learning Curve** | Familiar but requires layer mastery | Easiest of all versions |
| **Efficiency** | Traditional Miryoku efficiency | Maximum efficiency with minimal layers |
| **Best For** | Miryoku purists who dislike HRM | Users wanting simplicity + efficiency |

## Detailed Comparison

### Layer Structure

#### V3 (No HRM Dedicated) - 6 Layers
```
Base → Navigation → Symbols → Numbers → Function → Media
```
- **Traditional Miryoku structure** with dedicated modifiers
- Each layer serves a specific purpose following Miryoku principles
- Full separation of functions across layers

#### V4 (4-Layer Balanced) - 4 Layers
```
Base → Symbols → Nav/Num → Function
```
- **Streamlined approach** combining related functions
- Nav/Num layer merges navigation and numbers for efficiency
- Media functions integrated into other layers

### Modifier Placement

#### V3 Modifier Layout
- **Outer columns**: Ctrl (left), Alt (right)
- **Bottom row**: Shift keys on both sides
- **Thumb cluster**: GUI keys
- **Philosophy**: Spread modifiers across available positions

#### V4 Modifier Layout
- **Bottom outer**: Shift keys (left and right)
- **Thumb cluster**: Ctrl (left), Enter (right)
- **Strategic placement**: Modifiers where fingers naturally rest
- **Philosophy**: Minimal movement, maximum comfort

### Number and Symbol Access

#### V3 Number Access
```
Numbers: Dedicated layer (hold Nav → switch to Num layer)
Symbols: Dedicated layer (hold Sym → symbols on left hand)
```
- **Pure layer approach**: All numbers via layer switching
- **Consistent with Miryoku**: Maintains orthogonal design
- **More key presses**: Requires layer hold for all numbers

#### V4 Number Access
```
Numbers: Direct on top row (1-9, 0, -, =)
Symbols: Dedicated layer + shift access on base layer
```
- **Hybrid approach**: Direct access + layer access
- **Immediate efficiency**: No layer switching for basic numbers
- **Best of both worlds**: Direct access + layer organization

### Learning Progression

#### V3 Learning Path
1. **Week 1-2**: Master base layout without HRM complexity
2. **Week 3-4**: Add layer switching for numbers and symbols
3. **Week 5-6**: Master all 6 layers and their specific functions
4. **Timeline**: 6-8 weeks to full proficiency

#### V4 Learning Path
1. **Week 1**: Master base layout + direct number access
2. **Week 2-3**: Add symbols layer for punctuation
3. **Week 4**: Master Nav/Num combination layer
4. **Timeline**: 4-5 weeks to full proficiency

### Efficiency Comparison

#### V3 Efficiency Metrics
- **Layer switches per common task**: 2-3 switches
- **Common coding symbols**: Requires layer activation
- **Navigation**: Dedicated layer with full functionality
- **Typing flow**: Interruptions for numbers and symbols

#### V4 Efficiency Metrics
- **Layer switches per common task**: 1-2 switches
- **Common coding symbols**: Mix of direct and layer access
- **Navigation**: Combined with numbers for space efficiency
- **Typing flow**: Minimal interruptions for basic operations

## Use Case Recommendations

### Choose V3 (No HRM Dedicated) If You:
- ✅ **Want pure Miryoku experience** without HRM complexity
- ✅ **Don't mind layer switching** for numbers and symbols
- ✅ **Prefer traditional approach** with familiar modifier placement
- ✅ **Value consistency** in layer organization
- ✅ **Are migrating from traditional Miryoku** but dislike HRM
- ✅ **Have time to learn** all 6 layers properly

### Choose V4 (4-Layer Balanced) If You:
- ✅ **Want maximum efficiency** with minimal learning curve
- ✅ **Need frequent number access** for coding or data entry
- ✅ **Prefer streamlined workflow** with fewer layer switches
- ✅ **Want best of both worlds** (direct access + layers)
- ✅ **Are new to Miryoku concepts** and want gradual introduction
- ✅ **Value speed over purism**

## Practical Examples

### Common Coding Task: Type "function(123)"

#### V3 Process:
1. Type "function" (base layer)
2. Type "(" (base layer)
3. Hold Nav → switch to Numbers → type "123" → release
4. Type ")" (base layer)
**Total**: 4 distinct actions, 1 layer switch

#### V4 Process:
1. Type "function" (base layer)
2. Type "(" (base layer) 
3. Type "123" (direct access on base layer)
4. Type ")" (base layer)
**Total**: 4 actions, 0 layer switches

### Navigation Task: Move to beginning of line and select word

#### V3 Process:
1. Hold Nav → activate Navigation layer
2. Press Home (right hand)
3. Hold Shift + press Ctrl+Right (word select)
4. Release Nav
**Total**: Complex modifier combination with layer hold

#### V4 Process:
1. Hold Nav → activate Nav/Num layer
2. Press Home (right hand navigation area)
3. Use dedicated Shift + Ctrl for word selection
4. Release Nav
**Total**: Similar complexity but clearer modifier access

## Migration Path

### From Traditional Keyboard → V3
1. Start with base layer (familiar alpha layout)
2. Add dedicated modifiers (similar to traditional placement)
3. Gradually introduce layer concepts
4. Master each layer individually

### From Traditional Keyboard → V4
1. Start with base layer + direct numbers (most familiar)
2. Add symbols layer for punctuation
3. Introduce Nav/Num combined layer
4. Add function layer last

### From V3 → V4
1. **Keep**: Base layer muscle memory and modifier usage
2. **Add**: Direct number row access
3. **Combine**: Navigation and number layers
4. **Remove**: Media layer (functions distributed)

### From V4 → V3
1. **Keep**: Base layer and modifier patterns
2. **Separate**: Navigation and numbers into distinct layers
3. **Add**: Dedicated media layer
4. **Remove**: Direct number row dependency

## Performance Comparison

### Words Per Minute Impact
- **V3**: -10% from traditional during layer learning, returns to baseline
- **V4**: -5% from traditional during learning, potential +5% improvement

### Common Task Speed
- **Programming**: V4 wins (direct number access)
- **Writing**: Tie (both handle text well)
- **Navigation**: V3 slight edge (dedicated layer)
- **Data Entry**: V4 clear winner (direct numbers)

## Conclusion

**V3 (No HRM Dedicated)** is ideal for users who want the full Miryoku experience without Home Row Modifiers. It maintains the philosophical purity of the original system while removing the HRM learning curve.

**V4 (4-Layer Balanced)** is perfect for users who want maximum efficiency with minimum complexity. It represents the sweet spot between traditional keyboard familiarity and Miryoku's ergonomic benefits.

Both are excellent choices for avoiding HRM complexity - the decision comes down to whether you prioritize **Miryoku purity (V3)** or **practical efficiency (V4)**.
